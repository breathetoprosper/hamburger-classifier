NOTE:
1. this is a model that classifies if a picture has a burger or not
2. you are given a dataset folder has 3 folders:
2.1 hamburgers - this folder has 250 pictures with burgers in it
2.2 nohamburgers - this folder has 250 pictures without burgers in it
2.3 unseendata - this folder has 98 pictures with a mix to test the trained model and a csv file with the correct labels of each picture so you can then check the metrics.
